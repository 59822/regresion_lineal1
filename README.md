# RETO 8: Linear Regression 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a linear regression solution using Python and popular scientific libraries. The main objective of this project is to provide a basic introduction to linear regression, showing the steps to fit a line to a dataset.

## Project Description

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and one or more independent variables (predictors). In this project, we explore how to fit a simple linear model (one independent variable) to a dataset.

This notebook covers the following key steps:
1. **Importing necessary libraries**: We use libraries such as `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Scikit-learn`.
2. **Data loading and exploration**: A sample dataset is used, and the relationship between the variables is visualized.
3. **Implementing the linear regression model**: A simple linear regression model is trained using `Scikit-learn`.
4. **Visualizing the fitted model**: The regression line is plotted alongside the data points to visualize the fit.
5. **Model evaluation**: Metrics such as the coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) and the mean squared error are used to evaluate the model's quality.

## Project Structure

- `rl1.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the code necessary to perform linear regression.
- Sample data: Although not directly included in this repository, the notebook loads a dataset to perform the regression. You can customize this notebook to work with different datasets.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
